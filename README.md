# COMP0173_CW2_Crop_Classification

This repository contains my work for COMP0173 CW2.

[00_COMP0173_Write_Up](00_COMP0173_Write_Up.pdf) details:
  - Replication of Baseline Model
  - Contextualisation of crop classification, sustainability analysis and ethical considerations
  - Ppreprocessing, modelling, and hyperparameter tuning methodologies
  - Ablation studies
  - Analysis of results

The code for reproduction of results is available at [COMP0173_Crop_Classiciation](COMP0173_Crop_Classification.ipynb), produced in Google Colab. To replicate the results:
1. Create a Google Drive folder entitled 'COMP0173_Applying_New_Context' in your main drive; within this, create a folder entitled 'data' (this will match the data path to that used in the code: DATA_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/COMP0173_Applying_New_Context/data'). The code for mounting the drive is available in the .ipynb file.
2.
